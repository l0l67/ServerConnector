# ServerConnector
A discord bot wich can forward messages from multiple servers (connecting them)
to use the commands the user needs to have at least one role with administrator permissions

!!!! The Bot connects all servers on wich he is on, so if you want to have multiple versions you need to use an extra bot-token
